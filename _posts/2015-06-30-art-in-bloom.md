# Art in Bloom

Starting today through Sunday (3/19-3/22) the NC Art Museum presents [ART IN BLOOM][0] , the NCMA's inaugural festival of art and flowers. 45 stunning floral masterpieces created by world-class floral
designers from all around North Carolina and a few other states designed and created their masterpieces based on inspiration from select artwork from the permanent collection in the West Building. This
event is a ticketed exhibit and is a first for NCMA. The proceeds from this festival go directly to funding the museum's ongoing programming. 

The festival also includes [many additional events][0] such as master classes, floral demonstrations, and presentations by the floral designer for the Royal Family, internationally renowned floral artists, and
local florist owners and lecturers. Family events, wine tastings and trunk shows are also part of the line up. [(click here to see the museum's more detailed list of events)][0]

I was thrilled to get to tour the museum yesterday while the artists were busy putting together their works of art, allowing for a "behind the scenes" sneak peek. I loved seeing the permanent collection pieces
transformed with the partnering of these unique floral interpretations. Make sure to walk around the museum for plenty of eye-catching outdoor floral beauty. Catch the Bonsai Trees in the garden. Drink a
Joe Van Gogh Violet-Vanilla Bean Latte at Iris SIP. Enjoy this kickstart to Spring in Raleigh.

I hope that you can find time to get to the exhibit this weekend because, like the flowers, it is only available to enjoy for a very limited time before the blooms fade away.... 

_Tickets to Art in Bloom are $10 for NCMA members and $15 for nonmembers (free admission for children 6 and under). All related events (lectures, demonstrations, family activities) require separate tickets.
During the four days of Art in Bloom, tickets will be required for admission to the permanent collection in the Museum's West Building. East Building and the Museum Park will remain open and free to visitors._
