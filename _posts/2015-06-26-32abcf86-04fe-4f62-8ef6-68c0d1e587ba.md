Every year during the Christmas holidays, my employer closes down for two weeks and gives majority of employees a well-deserved break. After the holiday festivities are over, I like to spend time cleaning my office and the workshop. This is the second annual event and it typically takes me and my wife Melissa a few days to complete this enormous task. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/75c54eb1-dd78-48c5-8475-abb0d1923a78.jpg)
