Starting today through Sunday (3/19-3/22) the NC Art Museum presents [ART IN BLOOM][0], the NCMA's inaugural festival of art and flowers. 45 stunning floral masterpieces created by world-class floral designers from all around North Carolina and a few other states designed and created their masterpieces based on inspiration from select artwork from the permanent collection in the West Building. This event is a ticketed exhibit and is a first for NCMA. The proceeds from this festival go directly to funding the museum's ongoing programming.
